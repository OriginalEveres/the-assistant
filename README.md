# The assistant

## Overview

Building assistant in a browser with only pure javascript is a totally crazy idea. But I wanted to do something cool and I think this is pretty cool.

### Idea
Pure Javascript means, that this runs only in Google Chrome since Chrome has Speech libraries, etc. But, well, it runs. The major handicap of this is that it talks in your OS's language's accent.

### What will be implemented?
The next version will get a modular input. Simple JSon file with questions and anwers, later on with actions.
